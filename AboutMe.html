        <h2>It's-a Me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Chris Hoyt and I designed this website for the Intro to HTML & CSS course at Lansing Community College in the grand year of 2019.</p>
        <p>I have been an avid gamer since I could hold a controller; a trait which I most certainly inherited from my father who has been gaming since the
            the advent of video games, and well before. Growing up my friends and I played all sorts of video games from single player, to cooperative to competitive
            fighting games. The one series in particular that we spent the most time playing and perfecting was the Super Smash Bros. series.</p>
            <p>For us, Smash was a medium not only to better ourselves and our brains by understanding a complex system of patterns, decision-making and reflex, but it was
            a time for us to communicate and spend valuable time together. This mentality led to my interest in the tournament scene because I viewed the games not only
            as a path to self-betterment, but also as a way to hang out with and  get to know the people with whom I was playing.</p>
            <p>I have played Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. PM (a community-made mod), and now Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in
            tournaments and have made life-long friends through the community. For more information and some friendly starting points, try 
            clicking the character heads on the right side of the screen!
