    <h2>Try-Hard Stuff</h2>
    <p>Although there is no doubt that Sakurai and the folks at Hal Laboratories intended to create a fun and exciting fighting game, there is no way they could have predicted the ingenuity and passion of 
    fans of their revolutionary fighting game. What started as a kid's party game became a legacy and one of the most-viewed, and best-selling video games in history. Although there was a large tournament 
    scene for the original N64 Smash Bros. title, the true roots of the competitive scene began with the Gamecube version of the game: Super Smash Bros. Melee.</p>

    <p>Out of respect for the deep and unique physics-based mechanics of the game players began experimenting and looking for opportunities to gain an edge on their opponents. This research, or 'labbing' as it is 
    referred to in the nerd community, led to the discovery of "advanced techniques, or ATs, that opened new doors to higher levels of gameplay, and subsequently propelled the game toward new heights.</P>

    <p>The combination of the game's mechanics and a hunger for better and more exciting ways to defeat opponents turned Super Smash Bros. into a wonderful spectator sport. There are many factors that go into being a 
    "good" player, and there are many players from 2001 who are, to this day, remembered and revered as gods amongst fans of the series. </p>
